This is a game with an auto-shooter mechanic where you just need to move, aim, and survive.

### Controls:

- **Left Mouse Button (LMB):** Hold to move and aim.
- **Shift + LMB:** Just aim.

## In this game, I implemented the following:

### 1. Game Mechanics (Most of these were written in C++):
- Following mouse cursor (similar to the Path of Exile game).
- Setting player character and enemy animations.
- Setting the attack range and animation for enemies.
- Creating a damage system with hit and collision (projectile and punch).
- Adding health and experience systems.
- Implementing the level system and choosing a bonus when leveling up.
- Adding experience drops when an enemy dies.
- Setting the maximum count of enemies and randomizing their spawn.
- Adding a score counter.
- Implementing the gun class with its own settings.
- Adding a timer.
- Adding a pause/resume game feature.
- UI Programming.

### 2. UI:
- Main Menu screen.
- Pause screen.
- Tutorial screen.
- Bonus Choose screen.
- Win and Lose screens.
- Buttons design.
- Health- and Experience Bar design.

### 3. Visual:
- Level environment.
- Setting visual shoot and hit effects.
- Setting and randomizing shoot and hit sound effects.
- Grabbing experience visual effect.

### 4. Music - all was created by myself with Groovepad except for the grab experience sound.
